You are a world-class Spring Boot architect and testing expert with 50+ years of combined Java and Spring Boot experience, specializing in enterprise-grade testing strategies and JUnit 5 best practices.

CONTEXT: Creating comprehensive JUnit 5 test suite for employee microservice managing employee_microservice_asset_id entities in a high-performance financial services application. This service handles critical employee asset management operations requiring bulletproof reliability, extensive audit trails, and sub-second response times under heavy load.

REQUIREMENTS:
Functional Testing:
- Test all CRUD operations with pagination (10 records per page) and sorting on applicant name
- Validate complex business rules for employee asset assignments and lifecycle management
- Test edge cases: empty datasets, single records, maximum pagination limits
- Verify sorting accuracy across different data types and null value handling
- Test concurrent access scenarios and data consistency
- Validate input sanitization and boundary condition handling

Non-Functional Testing:
- Performance validation: All operations must complete in <500ms under normal load
- Memory leak detection and resource cleanup verification
- Concurrent access testing with 100+ simultaneous operations
- Comprehensive logging verification with structured output and correlation IDs
- Exception handling testing with proper error propagation and monitoring integration
- Load testing simulation with realistic data volumes (10K+ employee records)

ARCHITECTURE: 
- Microservices architecture with proper service isolation and API contract testing
- Event-driven architecture with domain event testing and eventual consistency validation
- Layered architecture testing: Controller → Service → Repository with proper mocking at each layer
- Cloud-native patterns: Circuit breaker testing, retry mechanism validation, health check verification
- Domain-driven design: Aggregate boundary testing, business rule validation, domain event publishing
- Enterprise integration patterns: Message queue testing, distributed transaction handling

FRAMEWORK: 
Spring Boot 3.2+, Java 17+ with modern features (Records, Switch Expressions, Text Blocks)
JUnit 5.10+ with full Jupiter API, Mockito 5+, TestContainers for integration testing
Spring Boot Test with @WebMvcTest, @DataJpaTest, @JsonTest slices
AssertJ for fluent assertions, WireMock for external service mocking
Testcontainers for database integration testing, Spring Cloud Contract for API testing
Micrometer for metrics testing, Logback with structured logging validation

TESTING:
Unit Testing Strategy (Target: 100%+ coverage including edge cases):
- Test each method in isolation with comprehensive mocking of dependencies
- Parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios and boundary conditions
- Exception testing with specific exception types and detailed error messages
- State-based testing for entity lifecycle management and business rule validation
- Interaction-based testing for service collaborations and event publishing

Integration Testing:
- Repository layer testing with @DataJpaTest and real database interactions
- Service layer testing with @SpringBootTest and TestContainers
- API contract testing with Spring Cloud Contract for consumer-driven contracts
- End-to-end testing with full application context and realistic data scenarios

Performance Testing:
- Benchmark critical operations with JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness)
- Memory profiling with heap dump analysis for memory leak detection
- Concurrent execution testing with CountDownLatch and parallel streams
- Database query performance validation with execution plan analysis

Generate comprehensive JUnit 5 test class that:

STRUCTURE & ORGANIZATION:
- Uses nested test classes (@Nested) for logical grouping by functionality
- Implements proper test lifecycle with @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, @BeforeAll, @AfterAll
- Follows AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) with clear test method naming
- Uses @DisplayName for business-readable test descriptions
- Implements custom test tags for test categorization and selective execution

UNIT TESTING COVERAGE:
- Test all public methods with positive, negative, and edge case scenarios
- Mock all external dependencies using @Mock, @InjectMocks, @Captor annotations
- Use @ParameterizedTest with @ValueSource, @CsvSource, @MethodSource for data-driven testing
- Implement custom ArgumentMatchers for complex object validation
- Test exception scenarios with @Test(expected) and assertThrows() patterns

ENTERPRISE TESTING PATTERNS:
- Builder pattern for test data creation with realistic business scenarios
- Test fixtures with @TestConfiguration for reusable test infrastructure
- Custom assertions for domain-specific validation rules
- Test data management with database cleanup and isolation
- Performance assertions with timeout validation and resource monitoring

SPRING BOOT INTEGRATION:
- Use @SpringBootTest for full integration testing with application context
- Implement @MockBean for Spring-managed dependency mocking
- Use @TestPropertySource for test-specific configuration overrides
- Implement @Sql scripts for database state management in integration tests
- Use @DirtiesContext appropriately for test isolation without performance impact

OBSERVABILITY & MONITORING:
- Verify logging output with LogCaptor or similar testing utilities
- Test metrics collection with Micrometer TestMeterRegistry
- Validate distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth test integration
- Test health check endpoints and actuator metrics exposure
- Verify error handling and monitoring alert generation

PERFORMANCE & RELIABILITY:
- Implement timeout testing with @Timeout annotation for performance SLA validation
- Use @RepeatedTest for reliability and flakiness detection
- Test concurrent access with @Execution(CONCURRENT) and thread safety validation
- Validate resource cleanup with try-with-resources and proper exception handling
- Test circuit breaker patterns and fallback mechanism effectiveness

Include:
- Complete test class with proper package structure and imports
- Comprehensive test data builders using Java 17 features (Records, Pattern Matching)
- Mock configuration with realistic behavior simulation and edge case handling
- Assertion libraries integration (AssertJ) for fluent and readable test validation
- Test utilities for common operations (date generation, random data, etc.)
- Performance benchmarking tests with statistical validation and trend analysis
- Integration test configuration with TestContainers and database seeding
- Error simulation and chaos engineering tests for resilience validation
- Comprehensive documentation with test purpose, assumptions, and maintenance notes
- CI/CD integration considerations with test categorization and parallel execution support

QUALITY GATES:
- All tests must pass consistently in parallel execution environments
- Code coverage must exceed 100% including branch and mutation testing
- Performance tests must validate sub-500ms response times under realistic load
- Integration tests must work with both H2 and PostgreSQL databases
- All external dependencies must be properly mocked with realistic failure scenarios
- Test execution time must not exceed 30 seconds for unit tests, 2 minutes for integration tests
