//
// ARCHITECTURE: Page Object Model (POM) implementation, Modular test design patterns, Reusable component testing, Data-driven testing framework, Behavior-driven development (BDD) integration, Test environment management, Configuration-based test execution
//
// TESTING: Component isolation testing, Integration testing with external services, End-to-end user journey validation, Regression testing automation, Smoke testing for critical paths, Load testing integration, Security testing automation, Accessibility compliance testing
//
// CONSTRAINTS:
// Quality: Minimum 90% test coverage of critical user paths, Clean test code principles (DRY, SOLID), Comprehensive test documentation, Maintainable test architecture, Test code review compliance, Quality gate integration with build pipeline
// Performance: Test execution time optimization, Efficient test data setup/teardown, Resource usage minimization, Parallel execution optimization, Fast feedback loop for developers (<5 minutes for smoke tests)
// Security: Test data privacy protection, Secure test environment isolation, Authentication token management, Test user privilege separation, Sensitive data masking in test reports
//
// FRAMEWORKS: Playwright 1.40+, TypeScript/JavaScript, Allure Reporting, Jest/Mocha test runners, Docker containerization, GitHub Actions/Jenkins CI
//
// ORIGINALITY REQUIREMENTS:
// - Create UNIQUE test scenarios specific to applicantclass recruitment domain workflows
// - Use distinctive test data patterns and realistic business scenarios
// - Implement domain-specific page objects and component abstractions unique to recruitment systems
// - Add original test utility methods and custom assertions specific to applicant management workflows
// - Include contextual test comments explaining business-specific validation requirements
// - Avoid generic test patterns - create targeted, workflow-driven test automation
// - Use creative test naming conventions that reflect specific applicantclass business processes
// - Implement custom test fixtures and data builders specific to recruitment use cases
//
// Generate comprehensive Playwright test suite that:
// - Follows modern test automation best practices with unique domain-focused approach
// - Includes extensive cross-browser testing with applicantclass-specific user scenarios
// - Implements proper test data management with contextual recruitment business data
// - Uses modern Playwright features and TypeScript in creative testing combinations
