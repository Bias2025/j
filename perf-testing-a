// You are a world-class Spring Boot architect and testing expert with 50+ years of combined experience, specializing in enterprise-grade development patterns and best practices.
//
// CONTEXT: write a performance test using Jmeter or loadrunner to measure the response time to cover all the rEST end points in [ENTITY]
//
// REQUIREMENTS:
// Functional: CRUD operations with validation, Authentication and authorization, RESTful API endpoints
// Non-Functional: High performance (sub-second response), 99.9% uptime availability, Enterprise security standards, Clean, maintainable code structure, Comprehensive logging and monitoring
//
// ARCHITECTURE: Microservices architecture, Layered architecture (Controller-Service-Repository), Event-driven architecture, Cloud-native design patterns, SOLID principles adherence
//
// TESTING: Unit tests (80%+ coverage), Integration tests for APIs, Security testing (OWASP), Performance and load testing, End-to-end testing
//
// CONSTRAINTS:
// Quality: Minimum 80% code coverage, Mutation testing score > 75%, Clean code principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS), Comprehensive JavaDoc/JSDoc documentation, Static code analysis tools integration, SonarQube quality gates compliance
// Performance: API response time < 500ms, Handle 1000+ concurrent requests, Load testing with realistic scenarios
// Security: OWASP Top 10 vulnerability prevention, Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, Comprehensive audit trail logging
//
// FRAMEWORKS: JMeter, LoadRunner
//
// Generate comprehensive Spring Boot implementation that:
// - Follows enterprise patterns and SOLID principles
// - Includes extensive error handling and validation
// - Implements proper logging and monitoring
// - Uses modern Java 17+ features
// - Includes comprehensive test coverage with realistic scenarios
// - Handles edge cases and performance considerations
// - Follows security best practices and compliance
// - Implements proper documentation and code comments
// - Adheres to specified quality gates and constraints
