// Non-Functional: High-performance query execution (<500ms), Memory-efficient response processing, Resilient error handling with retry mechanisms, Comprehensive logging and monitoring, Thread-safe client implementation, Connection pooling optimization, Response caching strategies, Asynchronous processing support, Reactive streams integration, Circuit breaker pattern implementation
//
// ARCHITECTURE: GraphQL client architecture patterns, Type-safe code generation, Reactive programming with WebFlux, Clean architecture principles, Dependency injection integration, Configuration-driven client setup, Error handling strategy patterns, Response mapping optimization, Connection management patterns
//
// TESTING: Unit tests for POJO mapping, Integration tests for GraphQL queries, Error scenario testing, Performance testing for large datasets, Contract testing with GraphQL schema, Mock server testing, Response validation testing
//
// CONSTRAINTS:
// Quality: Type-safe POJO generation, Comprehensive error handling, Clean code principles (SOLID, DRY), Null-safe operations with Optional, Immutable POJO design patterns, Validation annotations integration, Builder pattern implementation
// Performance: Query optimization for minimal data fetching, Efficient JSON deserialization, Connection reuse and pooling, Batch query optimization, Response caching implementation, Memory usage optimization
// Security: Secure authentication integration, Request/response logging with sensitive data masking, Input validation and sanitization, Rate limiting compliance, HTTPS enforcement
//
// FRAMEWORKS: Spring WebFlux, Jackson ObjectMapper, GraphQL Java Client, Apache HttpClient, Spring Boot, Lombok, Validation API
//
// ORIGINALITY REQUIREMENTS:
// - Create UNIQUE GraphQL client implementation specific to product domain with comprehensive business validation
// - Use distinctive POJO design patterns and custom mapping strategies
// - Implement domain-specific GraphQL query builders and response processors
// - Add original error handling patterns and custom exception types for GraphQL operations
// - Include contextual documentation explaining GraphQL integration patterns and business context
// - Avoid generic GraphQL client patterns - create targeted, business-driven API integration
// - Use creative query optimization and caching strategies specific to product data requirements
// - Implement custom GraphQL client extensions and utilities specific to product domain needs
//
// Generate comprehensive GraphQL Java client that:
// - Follows modern GraphQL client best practices with unique domain-focused approach
// - Includes extensive type-safe POJO mapping with product-specific validation
// - Implements proper error handling and resilience patterns for production environments
// - Uses modern Java 17+ features and reactive programming in creative combinations
// - Includes comprehensive documentation with realistic GraphQL integration scenarios
// - Handles edge cases specific to product domain requirements and GraphQL specifications
// - Follows security and performance best practices with custom optimization strategies
// - Implements proper monitoring and observability with business context explanations
// - Adheres to specified quality gates with unique GraphQL integration approach
// - Creates original client architecture that reflects specific product domain requirements
