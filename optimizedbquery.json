PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Identify and remediate the top CPU-intensive, slow Postgres queries and their application-side causes. Deliver measurable p95 latency gains and CPU reduction without downtime, while preparing the codebase and DB for the ongoing Java/Spring upgrade path.

CONTEXT
Domain: Government & Public Sector

Traffic/Data: 10K–100K users, 1K–10K RPS, 10–100 GB data

Current state:

Java 11, Spring Boot 2.7.x

Spring Security 5.7.x (via Boot 2.7)

PostgreSQL 14, Redis cluster, Kafka, Legacy SOAP integrations, OAuth2/OIDC (gov SSO)

Target alignment (parallel initiative):

Java 17, Spring Boot 3.2.x, Spring Security 6.2.x (separate track)

Constraints: Zero-downtime; GDPR/SOC2; ≤4h maintenance windows; budget-sensitive infra changes

Team: 8 devs (3 senior, 4 mid, 1 junior), Jenkins CI/CD

SUCCESS METRICS (must improve and verify)
Performance: p95 < 500 ms, 1000+ concurrent requests

Resource: DB CPU reduced ≥ 30% on peak workloads (or justify plateau)

Memory: < 512 MB heap per service (no new regressions)

Startup: < 30s (no regressions)

Availability: 99.9% SLA, graceful degradation, resilient circuits

Security/Quality: OWASP Top 10, RBAC, rate limiting, SQLi prevention, XSS protection, ≥80% test coverage, JSON logs, OpenTelemetry tracing, efficient Redis caching

INPUTS NEEDED
Last 7 days: pg_stat_statements (reset timestamps, normalized), pg_settings, pg_stat_user_tables, autovacuum & bloat indicators, lock wait logs

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE) for top 20 costly queries (by total_exec_time & mean_time)

Schema DDL & table stats (row counts, index definitions, FK graph)

Hibernate/JPA logs (SQL + bind), slow SQL logs (≥200 ms), Kafka consumer lag, Redis hit/miss

Connection pool metrics (Hikari) and JDBC driver flags

METHOD — 5 PHASES (run iteratively; no downtime)
1) Observe
Ensure: pg_stat_statements, track_io_timing=on, shared_preload_libraries='pg_stat_statements', slow-query logging (e.g., log_min_duration_statement=200ms), auto_explain with log_analyze=on, log_buffers=on in non-prod first.

Pull hotspots:SELECT queryid, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time, rows,
       shared_blks_hit, shared_blks_read, temp_blks_read, temp_blks_written
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

Tag each hotspot with pattern (N+1, missing index, sort spill, wide rows, bad pagination, ORMs gone wild, stale stats, lock contention).

2) Diagnose (deep)
Run EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) on hotspots; capture node costs, row est vs actual, heap vs index hits, temp spills, parallelization, and join order.

Check ORM drivers: N+1 (lazy collections in loops), unnecessary projections, SELECT *, accidental cartesian joins, DISTINCT or GROUP BY masking duplicates.

Identify anti-patterns:

Offset pagination on large sets → keyset pagination

Sequential scans on selective predicates → missing composite/partial indexes

Sort/hash aggregations → covering indexes / INCLUDE or pre-aggregation

Recomputing expensive read-mostly views → materialized views

Large hot tables → range/list partitioning (natural key like created_at)

Bloat/old stats → VACUUM/ANALYZE tuning, possible pg_repack (online)

Long-running TXNs & lock chains → fix transaction scope and retry/backoff logic

3) Fix (DB-first, app-aware)
Indexing

Composite indexes matching WHERE + JOIN + ORDER BY in left-to-right selectivity order.

Covering indexes with INCLUDE (columns) for read paths to avoid heap fetches.

Partial indexes for sparse predicates (WHERE status='ACTIVE').

Build online: CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ...; drop with DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY.

Query rewrite

Replace OFFSET/LIMIT with keyset pagination:

-- Example: after last_id
SELECT ... FROM t
WHERE (created_at, id) > (:lastCreatedAt, :lastId)
ORDER BY created_at, id
LIMIT :pageSize;
Remove SELECT *; use narrow projections.

Convert heavy CTEs to inline where beneficial (PG14 optimizes CTEs but verify plans).

Pre-aggregate with materialized views for expensive dashboards; schedule REFRESH ... CONCURRENTLY.

ORM/JDBC/Hikari tuning

Kill N+1: use fetch joins/DTO projections; spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.default_batch_fetch_size=50–200.

Bulk writes: hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=50, hibernate.order_inserts=true, hibernate.order_updates=true, JDBC reWriteBatchedInserts=true.

Turn off Open-Session-In-View if it extends TX scope.

Hikari: set maximumPoolSize to match DB max_connections via PgBouncer (see below); add leakDetectionThreshold.

Caching

Redis: cache idempotent read-mostly endpoints with short TTL + cache stampede protection; use cache-aside; invalidate on writes.

Partitioning (when table > ~50–100M rows or time-series)

Native range partitioning by time or tenant; ensure global index strategy is replaced by local indexes per partition.

Autovacuum & bloat

Lower autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor for hot tables; tune autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit.

Use pg_repack for extreme bloat (online, maintenance window aligned).

Postgres config (hardware-aware)

shared_buffers ~ 20–25% RAM; effective_cache_size 50–75% RAM;

work_mem sized per-connection (watch parallel nodes and joins) to avoid temp spills;

maintenance_work_mem higher during index build;

SSD: lower random_page_cost; set effective_io_concurrency appropriately;

Revisit max_parallel_workers_per_gather for big scans/aggregations.

Connection pooling

Put PgBouncer (transaction pooling) in front; cap app pools prudently to avoid CPU thrash from context switching.

4) Validate
Re-run pg_stat_statements diffs; compare p95 latency, CPU, shared_blk_read/hit ratios, temp spill counts.

Canary release for query/code changes; A/B key endpoints; verify trace spans and Redis hit rates.

Ensure audit logs & security controls unchanged.

5) Guardrail
Add regression tests for query plans using EXPLAIN snapshots (non-prod).

Add SLO alerts: p95, DB CPU, lock waits, temp files, autovacuum lag.

Set statement_timeout and lock_timeout per endpoint class.

Document runbooks for: adding indexes online, refreshing MVs, vacuum tuning, partition maintenance.

DELIVERABLES
Hotspot Report: Top 20 queries with root cause, fix, and before/after metrics.

DB Change Set: online index DDL, partitioning plan, MV definitions, autovacuum overrides, safe rollbacks.

App Change Set: ORM query rewrites, pagination fixes, batch configs, caching hooks, Hikari/JDBC flags.

Config Pack: postgresql.conf diffs, PgBouncer config, Spring Boot application-*.yml diffs.

Observability Pack: Grafana/OTel dashboards, alert rules, slow-query log parsers.

Playbooks: Zero-downtime procedures for each change type.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
p95 < 500 ms for top 10 endpoints under peak test load.

DB CPU reduced ≥ 30% at peak (or justified via IO-bound shift with higher throughput).

No error-rate or security regressions; audit logging preserved.

All data changes performed online (CONCURRENTLY/partition attach; no table rewrites).

Tests ≥ 80%, with plan-regression coverage on tuned queries.

RISKS & COUNTERMEASURES
Index build impact: Use CONCURRENTLY, stagger builds, throttle via maintenance_work_mem.

Plan flips: Lock critical plans with stable predicates or adjust stats targets; record plan baselines in tests.

Cache poisoning: Strict cache keys + short TTL + cache busting on writes.

Hidden N+1: Enforce DTO projections in code reviews; add detector tests.
