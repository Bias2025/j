    scalability:
      - Support concurrent user searches
      - Handle peak load scenarios
    reliability:
      - 99.9% uptime for search functionality
      - Graceful degradation on component failures
  compliance:
    - PCI-DSS for financial data
    - GDPR for user information
    - SOX compliance for audit trails
    ARCHITECTURE:
  pattern: Component-Based with Error Boundary Pattern
  style: Microservices with Angular Frontend
