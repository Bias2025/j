CONTEXT:
  domain: Enterprise Application Testing
  scale: Full-stack (Spring Boot + Angular)
  constraints: 
    - Internal LegoUX library dependency
    - Karma/Jasmine test framework
    - TypeScript/JavaScript frontend
    - JUnit 5 for backend
    - Maven build automation
  team: Mixed skill levels requiring comprehensive test coverage
  integration: 
    - Spring Boot REST APIs
    - Angular 18.2.x frontend
    - PostgreSQL database
    - LegoUX component library
    REQUIREMENTS:
  functional:
    - Generate unit tests for Spring Boot services/controllers
    - Create Angular component/service tests with Karma/Jasmine
    - Mock LegoUX library components
    - Achieve 90%+ code coverage
  non_functional:
    performance: Test execution < 30 seconds
    security: Input validation testing
    scalability: Parallel test execution
    reliability: Zero flaky tests
  compliance: OWASP security testing standards
  ARCHITECTURE:
  pattern: Test Pyramid (Unit → Integration → E2E)
  style: BDD with Given-When-Then structure
  layers:
    - Unit Tests: Isolated component testing
    - Integration Tests: API contract testing
    - Component Tests: Angular UI testing
    - E2E Tests: Full workflow validation
  data_flow: Test fixtures → Mocks → Assertions
