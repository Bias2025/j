TASK: upgrading from java 17 and springboot 3.2 using java upgrade tools, migrate the current springboot 2.7 application to use spring security 6

CONTEXT:
  domain: Government & Public Sector
  scale: 10K-100K users, 1K-10K RPS, 10-100GB data
  current_state:
    java_version: 11
    spring_boot: 2.7.x
    spring_security: 5.7.x (transitively via Spring Boot 2.7)
  target_state:
    java_version: 17
    spring_boot: 3.2.x
    spring_security: 6.2.x (Note: Spring Boot 3.x uses Security 6.x, not 5.8)
  constraints: 
    - Zero-downtime migration required
    - Regulatory compliance (GDPR, SOC2)
    - Limited maintenance window (4 hours max)
    - Budget constraints for infrastructure changes
  team: 
    - 8 developers (3 senior, 4 mid, 1 junior)
    - Mixed Spring Boot experience (2-8 years)
    - Existing CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins
  integration: 
    - Legacy SOAP services
    - OAuth2/OIDC with government SSO
    - PostgreSQL 14 database
    - Redis cache cluster
    - Kafka message queues

REQUIREMENTS:
  functional:
    - Maintain all existing REST API endpoints with backward compatibility
    - Preserve authentication/authorization logic during migration
    - Update deprecated Spring Security configurations
    - Migrate WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter to SecurityFilterChain
    - Update JWT token handling to latest standards
    - Maintain audit logging for compliance
  non_functional:
    performance: 
      - API Response time < 500ms (p95)
      - Handle 1000+ concurrent requests
      - Memory usage < 512MB heap
      - Startup time < 30 seconds
    availability:
      - 99.9% uptime SLA
      - Graceful degradation for external service failures
      - Circuit breaker patterns for resilience
    security:
      - OWASP Top 10 compliance
      - OAuth2/OIDC with PKCE flow
      - Role-based access control (RBAC)
      - API rate limiting
      - SQL injection prevention
      - XSS protection
    quality:
      - 80%+ test coverage
      - Clean, maintainable code structure
      - Comprehensive logging (structured JSON)
      - Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
      - Efficient caching strategy (Redis)
