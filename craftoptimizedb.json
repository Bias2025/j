REQUIREMENTS:
  primary_objective:
    - Identify and remediate top CPU-intensive, slow PostgreSQL queries and their application-side causes.
    - Achieve measurable improvements in p95 latency and DB CPU usage, with no downtime.
    - Prepare codebase and database for seamless upgrade to Java 17/Spring Boot 3.x.
  functional:
    - Analyze and optimize top 20 queries by total_exec_time and mean_time (via pg_stat_statements).
    - Deliver root-cause analysis for hotspots (e.g., N+1, missing indexes, lock contention).
    - Remediate ORM and JDBC query inefficiencies (pagination, projections, batching).
    - Implement and validate DB schema/index changes online (CONCURRENTLY).
    - Enhance caching (Redis), partitioning, and connection pooling strategies.
    - Maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs and integrations.
  non_functional:
    performance:
      - API p95 response: < 500 ms (top 10 endpoints, peak load)
      - DB CPU reduction: ≥ 30% at peak (or justify if IO-bound)
      - Memory: < 512 MB heap per service (no new regressions)
      - Startup: < 30s (no regressions)
    availability:
      - 99.9% uptime SLA
      - Graceful degradation and circuit breaker patterns for resilience
    security:
      - OWASP Top 10 compliance
      - RBAC, API rate limiting
      - SQL injection & XSS prevention
      - No regressions in audit logging or security posture
    quality:
      - ≥ 80% test coverage (including plan-regression coverage on tuned queries)
      - Comprehensive JSON logging and OpenTelemetry tracing
      - Efficient Redis caching
ARCHITECTURE:
  pattern: Layered (Service, Data, Integration, Security)
  migration_style: Zero-downtime, blue-green/canary deployments for query/code changes
  data_flow: Request/Response, batch processing (Kafka), cache-aside (Redis)
  DB optimization:
    - Online index builds (CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY)
    - Keyset pagination over OFFSET/LIMIT
    - Materialized/pre-aggregated views for heavy dashboards
    - Partitioning for large/hot tables (>50M rows, time-series)
    - Automated vacuuming and bloat control
    - Connection pooling with PgBouncer + HikariCP tuning
  resilience:
    - Circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts, and retries
    - Graceful fallback for failed DB/cache/message ops
  observability:
    - SLO alerts (p95, DB CPU, lock waits, temp files, autovacuum lag)
    - Plan-regression testing and monitoring
    - Structured audit and security event logging

PHASED METHOD (Iterative, Zero-Downtime)
1. Observe:

Enable and collect: pg_stat_statements, track_io_timing=on, slow-query logging, auto_explain, buffer stats (non-prod first).
Pull top 20 queries by total/mean exec time; tag root-cause patterns (N+1, missing index, bloat, etc).
2. Diagnose:

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) for all hotspots.
Investigate: ORM inefficiencies, bad pagination, selectivity, CTEs, lock contention, bloat, stats staleness, long TXs.
3. Fix (DB-first, app-aware):

Online index builds (CONCURRENTLY), composite/covering/partial indexes, partitioning.
Query rewrites: keyset pagination, narrow projections, DTOs, batch configs.
ORM/JDBC tuning: fetch/batch sizes, reWriteBatchedInserts, Hikari pool sizing and leak detection.
Redis caching and cache stampede protection.
Vacuum and autovacuum tuning, possible pg_repack.
Postgres config: buffer, work_mem, parallelism, IO tuning.
PgBouncer in front of DB, cap app-side pools.
4. Validate:

Re-collect metrics; compare p95, CPU, shared_blks, temp files.
Canary/A-B deploys; verify trace spans, Redis hit rates, and audit logs.
5. Guardrail:

Regression tests for query plans.
SLO alerts and plan-baseline monitoring.
Document runbooks for all change types (indexing, partitioning, vacuum, etc).
DELIVERABLES
Hotspot Report: Top 20 queries, root cause, fix, before/after metrics.
DB Change Set: Online index DDL, partitioning plan, MV definitions, autovacuum overrides, rollback plans.
App Change Set: ORM query rewrites, pagination fixes, batch configs, caching hooks.
Config Pack: postgresql.conf, PgBouncer, Spring Boot application-*.yml diffs.
Observability Pack: Dashboards, alert rules, log/trace parsers.
Playbooks: Zero-downtime procedures for each change type.
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
API p95 for top 10 endpoints < 500 ms (peak).
DB CPU reduced ≥ 30% at peak (or justified).
No error-rate or security regressions; audit logging preserved.
All DB changes performed online (no blocking table rewrites).
≥ 80% test coverage, including plan-regression tests.
INPUTS REQUIRED
Last 7 days: pg_stat_statements, pg_settings, pg_stat_user_tables, autovacuum/bloat, lock logs.
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE) for top 20 queries.
Schema DDL, table stats, index/fkey graph.
Hibernate/JPA logs, slow SQL logs, Kafka lag, Redis hit/miss, Hikari/JDBC metrics.
RISKS & COUNTERMEASURES
Index build impact: Use CONCURRENTLY, stagger, throttle.
Plan flips: Lock plans, record baselines, adjust stats targets.
Cache poisoning: Strict keys, short TTL, bust on writes.
N+1 risk: Enforce DTO projections, add detector tests.
Rollback: All changes reversible online, with runbook and baseline restore.
